#### blogc is simple...

blogc was designed with simplicity in mind. If the implementation of some
feature requires a very complex change, it is discarded.

#### blogc is powerful...

Based on the flexibility of its template engine, even considering that it
just implements the basic features of a template engine, blogc can be used
to generate almost any blog/website resource, including atom feeds and
sitemaps.

#### blogc is compatible with `make`...

blogs was designed to be used with `make`. It is stateless and idempotent
(no global state is shared between process calls, and each call with the
same arguments will always result in the same output), and works pretty
much like a "real" source code compiler.

#### blogc is portable...

blogc is tested on Linux, FreeBSD and Microsoft Windows, but the code
should work on any POSIX-compliant operating system as well. Patches for
portability are always welcome and have high priority.

#### blogc is self-contained...

blogc just depends on a libc and [squareball]
(https://github.com/rafaelmartins/squareball), that is an utility library
based on code extracted from old versions of blogc itself. squareball library
is bundled in blogc, then users don't need to install any dependency manually.
The test suite (yes, blogc comes with a somewhat complete test suite!)
depends on [cmocka](http://cmocka.org/), but users aren't required to run it.

#### blogc is designed for developers...

Due to its simplicity and similarity to a "real" source code compiler,
blogc is meant to be used by software developers, that are used to work
with `make` and similar development tools.

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### Is this a blog engine?

No, it is just a blog compiler. It will only build one file at once, and does
not know anything about the other files that needs to be built to get a full
blog working. This is a job for a build tool like ``make``.

#### What is its markup language?

blogc comes with its own markup language, see
[blogc-source(7)](./man/blogc-source.7.html). The language is quite similar to
John Gruber's Markdown, but differs in some aspects.

#### But why not just support Markdown?

While the blogc markup language is quite simple, we have plans to support
advanced features that are not part of Markdown, like something similar
to [reStructuredText directives](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html).
Also, this project is an experiment, and one of the targets of the experiment
is the markup language.

#### How can I get started with blogc?

You should install it from [github](https://github.com/blogc/blogc) or
from a [stable release](https://github.com/blogc/blogc/releases). It
is a standard autotools project, that can be built with ``./configure && make
&& make install``.

There's also a Git repository with an example blog:
[[https://github.com/blogc/blogc-example]]

Feel free to clone it, remove ``.git`` and start your brand new blog.

The example repository uses GNU Make. You should be able to write a Makefile
that only uses POSIX features, and get it working with any ``make``
implementation, but our example uses lots of GNU features. This should be
fixed in future.

#### What the name "blogc" means?

"blogc" stands for "blog compiler". The name has nothing to do with the
programming language used to implement it. ;-)

#### I don't like ``make``, what can I do about it?

You are free to use any other build tool you like. You can even use something
like ``grunt``, if you really want. blogc is a command-line application, like
any other. Anything that can call command-line tools should work just fine.

Our example repository uses GNU Make, though.
